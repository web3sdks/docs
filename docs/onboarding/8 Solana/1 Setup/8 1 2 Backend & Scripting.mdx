Backend services are suitable for when you need to perform actions from _**your**_ wallet or simply need to **read** data;
rather than connecting to your user's wallets. It's also a great way to perform actions on behalf of your users.

There are multiple different ways you can instantiate the SDK and use it, which vary depending on what you need to do.

To get started, install the SDK:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3sdks/sdk
```

## Read-only SDK

Provide the network or your own RPC URL to start reading data from any Solana program.

```javascript
import { Web3sdksSDK } from "@web3sdks/sdk/solana";

// Simply pass in the network you want to connect to
// can be one of "mainnet-beta", "devnet", "testnet", "localhost" or your own RPC url
const sdk = Web3sdksSDK.fromNetwork("devnet");
```

## Read-Write SDK

To execute transactions, you will need to connect a wallet to the SDK. All transactions you make will be signed by the wallet you provide.

### From an existing private key

To connect the SDK with a specific wallet, you can pass in the wallet's private key.

```javascript
import { Web3sdksSDK } from "@web3sdks/sdk/solana";

const privateKey = "..."; // Consider fetching this from a secrets manager
const sdk = Web3sdksSDK.fromPrivateKey("devnet", privateKey);
```

:::warning

Ensure you store and access your private key securely.

- Check if you need to use a private key for your application.
- **Never** directly expose your private key in your source code.
- **Never** commit any file that may contain your private key to your source control.
- **Never** use a private key for a frontend (website/dapp) application.

If you are unsure how to securely store and access your private key, please do not proceed.

### Using the Solana CLI Tool

If you have the [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) tool installed, you can follow the setup steps to generate a keypair.

That keypair will be written to the default path, and the SDK can read from that path to initialize the SDK with the wallet generated by the Solana CLI.

This is a great choice for local scripting using NodeJS.

```javascript
import { createWeb3sdksSDK } from "@web3sdks/sdk/solana/server";
// create the SDK using the default path for the Solana CLI keypair
const sdk = createWeb3sdksSDK("devnet");
```

Note that the `createWeb3sdksSDK` function was imported from `@web3sdks/sdk/solana/server` and is only supported on NodeJS environments.
