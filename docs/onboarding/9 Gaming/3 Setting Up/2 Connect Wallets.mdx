# Connect User Wallets

Ask users to connect their wallets to your game. This allows you to ask them to sign transactions.

To [write transactions to the blockchain](/gamingkit/interact-with-contracts/write-transactions), you must have a connected wallet first.

```csharp
// Ask the user to connect their wallet and read their wallet address.
string address = await sdk.wallet.Connect();
```

## Connect to a particular Wallet provider

You can pick and choose how you want your users to connect to your application. The SDK supports:

- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- WalletConnect
- any injected browser extension like TrustWallet and others.

You can also specify which chain you want your users to connect to, here's an example:

```csharp
// Connect to the user's wallet via CoinbaseWallet
string address = await sdk.wallet.Connect(new WalletConnection()
        {
            provider = WalletProvider.CoinbaseWallet,
            chainId = 5 // Switch the wallet Goerli on connection
        });
```

## Read Wallet Information

Once connected, you can access information about the user's [Wallet](/unity/Wallet).

```csharp
// For example, we can now read the user's native token balance.
var balance = await sdk.wallet.GetBalance();
```
