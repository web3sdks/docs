# Wallet State

Once a user has [connected](/gamingkit/setting-up/connect-wallets) to your game,
use the [Wallet](/unity/Wallet) class to interact with the connected wallet.

## Read Wallet State

Read information about the connected wallet.

### Check Wallet Connection

Check if the user has connected their wallet to your game.

```csharp
bool isConnected = await sdk.wallet.IsConnected();
```

### Wallet Address

If the user has connected their wallet to your game, read their wallet address.

```csharp
string address = await sdk.wallet.GetAddress();
```

### Current Network

View the [chain ID](/typescript/sdk.chainid) of the network the user is connected to.

```csharp
int chainId = await sdk.wallet.GetChainId();
```

### Balance (Native Token)

Read the balance of the native token of the network the user is connected to.

For example, if the user is connected to the Ethereum Mainnet, this will return the balance of ETH.

```csharp
CurrencyValue balance = await sdk.wallet.GetBalance();
```

## Change Wallet State

Request the user to change their wallet state.

These functions are especially useful to ensure the user is on the correct network before signing a transaction.

### Switch Network

```csharp
await sdk.wallet.SwitchNetwork(chainId);
```

### Disconnect Wallet

```csharp
await sdk.wallet.Disconnect();
```
