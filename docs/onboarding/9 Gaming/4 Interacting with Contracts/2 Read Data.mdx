After you have [instantiated the SDK](/gamingkit/setting-up/instantiating-the-sdk)
and [connected to a smart contract](/gamingkit/interact-with-contracts/connect-to-a-contract),
you can read any data from the contract.

## Feature Functions

The SDK includes a comprehensive set of helper functions to read and format data from your smart contract.

Any [Prebuilt contract](prebuilt-contracts) or contract built using [ContractKit](/contractkit) has access to these functions in the SDK.

```csharp
var nfts = await contract.ERC721.GetAll(); // ERC721
var nftOne = await contract.ERC1155.Get(1); // ERC1155
var totalSupply = await contract.ERC20.TotalSupply(); // ERC20
```

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="View All Unity SDK Code Snippets"
      link="/sdk/interacting-with-contracts"
      image="/assets/product/sdk.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Function By Name

Call any contract `function`, `mapping`, `view`, or `variable` using the `Read` method and providing any required arguments:

```csharp
// Below, we specify that we expect a string to be returned from "functionName" on the contract
var string = await contract.Read<string>("functionName", arg1, arg2);
```
