# Connect To A Contract

For smart contracts deployed using web3sdks via the [dashboard](/dashboard) or [deploy](/deploy),
provide it's address to the `GetContract` method to get a contract instance.

```csharp
// Ensure your sdk is initialized to the same network as the contract
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("<your-smart-contract-address>");
```

The `Contract` instance has type-safe functionality to interact with your smart contracts, including:

- [ERC20](/unity/ERC20)
- [ERC721](/unity/ERC721)
- [ERC1155](/unity/ERC1155)

### Marketplaces

If you're using the [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace), you can access that in the contract's `marketplace` field:

```csharp
Marketplace marketplace = contract.marketplace;
```

## Using Contract ABI

For any smart contract that is not deployed using web3sdks, you can provide the
contract's [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/abi-spec.html)
as a second argument to the `GetContract` method to get an instance of it.

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("<your-smart-contract-address>", "<your-contract-abi>");
```
