# Write Transactions

Writing transactions to the blockchain requires you to [connect to a wallet](/gamingkit/setting-up/connect-wallets) first.

## Feature Functions

The SDK includes a comprehensive set of helper functions to write transactions to your smart contract.

Any [Prebuilt contract](prebuilt-contracts) or contract built using [ContractKit](/contractkit) has access to these functions in the SDK.

```csharp
// Each of the below calls will prompt the user to approve a transaction:
var result1 = await contract.ERC721.Burn("0"); // ERC721
var result2 = await contract.ERC1155.Claim("0", 1); // ERC1155
var result3 = await contract.ERC20.Transfer("<to-wallet-address>", "<amount-of-tokens>"); // ERC20
```

## Function By Name

Call any contract `function` using the `Write` method and providing any required arguments:

```csharp
var result = await contract.Write("functionName", arg1, arg2);
```

## Checking Transaction Status

The [TransactionResult](/unity/TransactionResult) returned by any transaction contains an `isSuccessful` function that returns a `bool`:

```csharp
var result = await contract.Write("functionName", arg1, arg2);
if (result.isSuccessful())
{
    // Transaction was successful
}
else
{
    // Transaction failed
}
```
