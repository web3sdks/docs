# Permission Controls

Permissions outline which wallet addresses can perform which actions on your smart contract.

You can invite team members using their wallet addresses to have different levels of permissions on your smart contract under the **Permissions** tab.

To define which wallets have these permissions, you must add them to the required role.

Each contract has a different set of configurable roles, you can find the full list in the [ALL_ROLES](/typescript/sdk.all_roles#all_roles-variable) variable.
