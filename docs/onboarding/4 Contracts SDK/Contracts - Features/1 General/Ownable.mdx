# Ownable

```solidity
import "@web3sdks/contracts/extension/Ownable.sol";
```

The `Ownable` smart contract extension is usable with any base smart contract. It lets you set an owner for your smart contract.

  name="Ownable"
/>

## Availability in base contracts

The `Ownable` extension is _already_ available in the following [base contracts](/contractkit/base-contracts):

- All ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 base contracts.

## Unlocked Features

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these contracts on the SDK and dashboard:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Contract Owner"
      link="/sdk/advanced-features/contract-settings#contract-owner"
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Implementing the Contract

The `Ownable` extension is an _abstract contract_, and expects you to implement the following functions by yourself:

| Name                                                                    | Type                    | Parameters | Returns | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`_canSetOwner`](/contractkit/extension-contracts/ownable#_cansetowner) | internal view _virtual_ | n/a        | `bool`  | Runs on every attempt to set the owner of the contract. Returns whether the owner can be set in the given execution context. |

## Full API reference

### owner

```solidity
function owner() public view override returns (address);
```

- Returns the owner of the contract.
- Set this value using the `setOwner` function.

### setOwner

```solidity
function setOwner(address _newOwner) external;
```

- Lets an authorized wallet set a new owner for the contract. This value can be read from the `owner` function.
- Parameter `_newOwner`: The address to make the owner of the contract.
- The `_canSetOwner` function is run on every call to this function. If the return value of `_canSetOwner` is `false`, the `setOwner` call will revert.

### \_setupOwner

```solidity
function _setupOwner(address _newOwner) internal;
```

- Sets the owner of the smart contract. This value can be read from the `owner` function.
- Parameter `_newOwner`: The address to make the owner of the contract.
- The `_canSetOwner` function is _not_ run on a call to this function.

### \_canSetOwner

```solidity
function _canSetOwner() internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

- Runs on every `setOwner` function call.
- Returns whether a new owner can be set in the given execution context.
- For example, this function can check whether the wallet calling `setOwner` is the contract owner, and enforce that only the current owner should be able to successfully call `setOwner`.
