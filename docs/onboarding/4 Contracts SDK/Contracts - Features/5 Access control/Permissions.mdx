# Permissions

```solidity
import "@web3sdks/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";
```

<div className="heroGrid">
<div>

<p>
  Add permissions to your smart contract to control which addresses can perform
  certain actions.
</p>

The `Permissions` extension provides role-based access control: you can create roles and write custom logic in your smart contract that depends on whether a given wallet holds a given role.

</div>

</div>
</div>

There are two different contracts you can implement to add permissions:

- `Permissions`: Create roles and restrict access to functions based on those roles.
- `PermissionsEnumerable`: `Permissions` plus the capability to view all the addresses holding a specific role (or all roles).

You only need to implement **one** of the two.

## Availability in base contracts

The `Permissions` and `PermissionsEnumerable` extensions are _not_ already included in any [base contracts](/contractkit/base-contracts). To use this extension, check out the [implementation guide](/contractkit/extension-contracts/platformfee#implementing-the-contract-extension) and [full API reference](/contractkit/extension-contracts/permissions#full-api-reference).

## Unlocked Features

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these contracts on the SDK and dashboard:

<div className="row" style={{ marginBottom: 24, flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <div className="col col--12" style={{ padding: 8 }}>
    <QuickstartCard
      name="Permission Controls"
      link="/sdk/advanced-features/permission-controls"
      image="/assets/icons/general.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Implementing the Contract

Import the contract and make your contract inherit it.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@web3sdks/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyContract is Permissions {
    // Any `bytes32` value is a valid role. You can create roles by defining them like this.
    bytes32 public constant NUMBER_ROLE = keccak256("NUMBER_ROLE");

    // See comments for `setNumber`, below.
    uint256 public number;

    /**
     *  The `Permissions` contract makes an already defined role available: the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
     *
     *  As an EXAMPLE, we grant the deployer of the contract this admin role.
     */
    constructor() {
        _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }

    /**
     *  EXAMPLE: here we have a function that we want to restrict only to holders of `NUMBER_ROLE`.
     *
     *  To accomplish this, we use the `onlyRole` modifier made available by `Permissions`, and
     *  pass it `NUMBER_ROLE` as an argument.
     */
    function setNumber(uint256 _newNumber) public onlyRole(NUMBER_ROLE) {
        number = _newNumber;
    }
}
```

## Full API Reference

### hasRole

```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.

### getRoleAdmin

```solidity
function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32);
```

- Returns the admin role that controls `role` i.e. the holders of the admin role (the return value) can grant or revoke `role` from wallets.

### grantRole

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Grants `role` to `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

### revokeRole

```solidity
function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from `account`. Can only be called by a holder of the admin role of the role being granted.

### renounceRole

```solidity
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account) external;
```

- Revokes `role` from the calling account.

### hasRoleWithSwitch

```solidity
function hasRoleWithSwitch(bytes32 role, address account) public view returns (bool);
```

- Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.
- Role restrictions can be swtiched on and off:
  - If `address(0)` has `role`, then the role restrictions don't apply i.e. this function will always return `true`.
  - If `address(0)` does not have `role`, then the role restrictions will apply i.e. this function will behave like `hasRole`.

### getRoleMember (PermissionsEnumerable)

```solidity
function getRoleMember(bytes32 role, uint256 index) external view returns (address);
```

- Returns one of the accounts that have `role`. `index` must be a value between 0 and the value of `getRoleMemberCount` at the time, non-inclusive.

### getRoleMemberCount (PermissionsEnumerable)

```solidity
function getRoleMemberCount(bytes32 role) external view returns (uint256);
```

- Returns the number of accounts that have `role`. Can be used together with `getRoleMember` to enumerate all bearers of a role.
