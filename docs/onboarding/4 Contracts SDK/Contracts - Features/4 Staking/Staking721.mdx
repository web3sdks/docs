## Availability in base contracts

The `Staking721` is _already_ available in the following [base contracts](/contractkit/base-contracts).

- **ERC721**: [`Staking721Base`](/contractkit/base-contracts/staking/staking721base)

## Implementing the Contract

Import the contract and make your contract inherit it.

## Full API Reference

### stake

```solidity
function stake(uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external;
```

- Lets a user stake a number of ERC721 tokens by passing in token-Ids.
- Parameter `tokenIds`: List of token-Ids to stake.

### withdraw

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external;
```

- Un-stake and withdraw NFTs from the contract.
- Parameter `tokenIds`: List of token-Ids to withdraw.

### claimRewards

```solidity
function claimRewards() external;
```

- Claim accumulated rewards. This claim method allows for a pull mechanism where users must initiate claiming of rewards.

### getStakeInfo

```solidity
function getStakeInfo(address staker) external view returns (uint256 tokensStaked, uint256 rewards);
```

- View number of NFTs staked and total rewards available for a user.
- Parameter `staker`: Account address of staker.

### setRewardsPerUnitTime

```solidity
function setRewardsPerUnitTime(uint256 rewardsPerUnitTime) external;
```

- Allows an authorized account to set rewards per unit of time. Interpreted as x rewards per second/per day/etc based on time-unit.
- Parameter `rewardsPerUnitTime`: New rewards per unit time.

### setTimeUnit

```solidity
function setTimeUnit(uint256 timeUnit) external;
```

- Allows an authorized account to set time unit as a number of seconds. For e.g. 1 hour can be set as 3600 seconds - setting the reward frequency as _per hour_.
- Parameter `timeUnit`: New time unit.
