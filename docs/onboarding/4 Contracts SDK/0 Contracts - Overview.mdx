- **Base Contracts** that you can build upon, such as [ERC721Base](/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base).
- **Extension contracts** that you can plug-in to unlock specific functionality, such as [Permission Controls](/contractkit/extension-contracts/permissions) and [Royalty Fees](/contractkit/extension-contracts/royalty).
- **Interfaces** that you can implement, and use to interact with other contracts that use **ContractKit**.

:::info Solana Programs

ContractKit is coming to Solana soon!

In the meantime, you can use the [programs](/solana/creating-programs) we have available.

:::

To get started, run the command below to create a new project with your preferences set up:

```bash
npx web3sdks@latest create contract
```

Or install the `contracts` package into your existing Solidity project:

```bash
npm install @web3sdks/contracts
```

## Why Use ContractKit?

Each feature you implement in your smart contracts unlocks functionality in both the dashboard and SDK to help you build applications on top of them.

For example, if you implement the [ERC721Base](/contractkit/base-contracts/erc-721/erc721base) contract, you'll unlock the `mint` button in the dashboard and
can use the [mint](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc721mintable) function in the SDK; which automatically uploads and pins your metadata to IPFS!

## How To Use ContractKit

You can use ContractKit to build out your smart contract project _end-to-end_, or to simply add features to your own, existing smart contract.

### Using Base Contracts

ContractKit gives you [**base contracts**](/contractkit/base-contracts) that you can use as the foundation of your smart contract.

**1.** To start, import and inherit the base contract that is right for your project. You can find the list of all available base contracts [here](/contractkit/base-contracts#list-of-base-contracts).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@web3sdks/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

// Error: Contract "MyNFT" should be marked as abstract.
contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {}
```

**2.** Base contracts expect certain constructor arguments to function as intended. Implement a constructor for your smart contract and pass the
appropriate values to the constructor of your base contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@web3sdks/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
}
```

**3.** Now you're all set up! ðŸŽ‰ Your smart contract now has all the functionality provided by the base contract it inherits and is ready to be deployed to any EVM blockchain of your choice.

### Using Extension Contracts

With the foundation for your smart contract ready, you can now plug-in additional features to your smart contract using [**extension contracts**](/contractkit/extensions).

**1.** To start, import and inherit the extension contract that is right for your project. You can find the list of all available extensions [here](/contractkit/extensions#list-of-extensions).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@web3sdks/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";
import "@web3sdks/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, Permissions {
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}
}
```

**Note:** for some extension contracts (e.g. [`LazyMint`](/contractkit/extension-contracts/lazymint)) you may see the following error at this step: `Contract "MyNFT" should be marked as abstract.`
No problem! To resolve this error, look at the usage guide for the particular extension contract you're using.

**2.** Use the functions provided by the extension contract to change the behaviour of your smart contract.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@web3sdks/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol";
import "@web3sdks/contracts/extension/Permissions.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721Base, Permissions {
    bytes32 private constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");

    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _royaltyRecipient,
        uint128 _royaltyBps
    ) ERC721Base(_name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps) {}

    /**
     *  `_canMint` is a function available in `ERC721Base`.
     *
     *  It is called every time a wallet tries to mint NFTs on this
     *  contract, and lets you define the condition in which an
     *  attempt to mint NFTs should be permitted, or rejected.
     *
     *  By default, `ERC721Base` only lets the contract's owner mint
     *  NFTs. Here, we override that functionality.
     *
     *  We use the `Permissions` extension to specify that anyone holding
     *  "MINTER_ROLE" should be able to mint NFTs.
     */
    function _canMint() internal view override returns (bool) {
        return hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
