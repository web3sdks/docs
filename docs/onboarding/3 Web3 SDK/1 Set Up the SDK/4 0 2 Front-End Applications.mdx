# Building Frontend Applications

You can build front-end applications by using our [React](/react) and [TypeScript](/typescript) SDKs!

Front-end applications are best-suited when you want users to connect their wallets to your web application and interact with your contracts using their wallet; such as an [NFT Minting Website](/templates/nft-drop).

## Automatic Set Up

The easiest way to get started is by using the [web3sdks CLI](/cli).

This interactive tool creates a new project with web3sdks pre-configured with a framework and language of your choice.

```bash
npx web3sdks@latest create app --evm
```

That's it! You're project is ready to start interacting with your contract!

:::tip Starter Kits & Templates

You can start with one of our [template projects](/templates) by passing the `--template` flag and the name of the example repo.

## Manual Installation

If you have an **existing** project you want to integrate web3sdks into, install the web3sdks SDKs:

```bash
npm install @web3sdks/react @web3sdks/sdk ethers
```

Then wrap your application in the `Web3sdksProvider` to get started!

```jsx
import { Web3sdksProvider, ChainId } from "@web3sdks/react";

// the chainId our app wants to be running on
// for our example the Polygon Mumbai Testnet
const desiredChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <Web3sdksProvider desiredChainId={desiredChainId}>
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </Web3sdksProvider>
  );
};
```

### From a Signer / Provider

```jsx
import { ChainId, Web3sdksSDKProvider } from "@web3sdks/react";

// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mainnet;

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  // If you want to use any custom provider or signer, add it here.
  const myProvider = ...;
  const mySigner = ...;


  return (
    <Web3sdksSDKProvider
      desiredChainId={activeChainId}
      signer={mySigner}
      provider={myProvider}
    >
      {/* Your App Goes Here */}
    </Web3sdksSDKProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
