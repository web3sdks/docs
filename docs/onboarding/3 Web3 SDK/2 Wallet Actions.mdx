# Wallet Actions

Perform basic web3 actions using the currently connected wallet address, or the wallet you initialized the SDK with.

## Get Native Token Balance

Get the balance of the currently connected wallet address in the native token.

The "native" token refers to the token that is used to pay gas fees for the current chain.

For example, if you are on the Ethereum Mainnet, the native token is `Ether`.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"UserWallet"}
  name={"balance"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>

## Get Connected Wallet Address

Get the currently connected wallet's public address, if there is one.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"UserWallet"}
  name={"getAddress"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>

## Transfer Tokens

Transfer a specified quantity of either the native token or a specified ERC20 token to another wallet address.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"UserWallet"}
  name={"transfer"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>

## Sign A Message

<div className="heroGrid">
  <div>
    <p>Sign a message you specify with the currently connected wallet.</p>

Message signing can be utilized to prove that a user owns a wallet address.

After a user has signed the message, you can then verify which wallet address signed the message
by using the [`recoverAddress`](#recover-signing-address) method.
