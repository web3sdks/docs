      Our SDKs enable you to build web3 applications, with capabilities such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting to user's wallets</li>
      <li>Deploying and interacting with smart contracts</li>
      <li>
        Utilizing the <a href="/contractkit/extensions">extensions</a> you
        implemented in Solidity

  We support the following languages <i>(and are working on more)</i> to make it
  easier for you to build applications.

## Quick Start

Set up a new web application with the [React](/react) and [JavaScript](/javascript) SDKs set up using the CLI.

```bash
npx web3sdks@latest create app
```

Start with a basic configuration with the language and framework of your choice,
or choose one of our [templates](/templates) to get a headstart by passing the `--template` flag and the name of a [template repository](/templates).

## Using the SDK

Depending on the type of application you want to build, we've separated the getting started
flow into two pages.

1. [Frontend Applications](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/frontend): **Web-applications** that connect to users' wallets to let them interact with smart contracts.
2. [Backend & Scripting](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/backend): Use your own wallet to interact with smart contracts.
