# ERC1155 - Claim Conditions

ERC1155Claimable is an extension of [ERC1155Claimable](/sdk/interacting-with-contracts/erc1155claimable) that enables claim conditions.

You can utilize these features of the SDK on your contract if it implements [Drop for ERC 1155](/contractkit/extension-contracts/dropsinglephase1155).

## Configure claim conditions

Define the criteria of how NFTs can be claimed from your drop.

Each claim phase can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs to drop
- How much to charge per NFT
- What currency to use to sell the NFTs
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per wallet
- Metadata for the claim condition
