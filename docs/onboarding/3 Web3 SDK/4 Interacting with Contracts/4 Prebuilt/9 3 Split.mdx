# Split

Learn how to interact with your [Split](/pre-built-contracts/split) contract in the SDK.

## Create a Split Contract

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"ContractDeployer"} name={"deploySplit"} />

## Getting the contract in your application

To start using your Split contract inside your application, you'll need to use its contract address.
You can get the contract address from the [dashboard](https://web3sdks.com/dashboard).

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Split"}
  name={"initializing the SDK"}
  isGetContractCode
  dontShowSummary
  snippetOverrides={{
    unity: `// Split is not yet supported in Unity. Reach out to us on Discord if you need this feature! \Split contract = sdk.GetContract("{{contract_address}}").split`,
  }}
/>

## View Recipients

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Split"} name={"getAllRecipients"} />

## View Balance

### Native Token Balance

Use this if you have been tokens native to the network (e.g., `Ether` on the Ethereum network).

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Split"} name={"balanceOf"} />

### Non-Native Token Balance

Use this if you have been sent custom tokens to the address.

<CodeSnippetWithSummary contract={"Split"} name={"balanceOfToken"} />

## Distribute funds

This distributes funds held by the contract to **all recipients**.

### Native Token

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Split"}
  name={"distribute"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

### Non-Native Token

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Split"}
  name={"distributeToken"}
  dontShowSummary
/>

## Withdraw Funds

<CodeSnippetWithSummary
  contract={"Split"}
  name={"withdraw"}
  dontShowSummary
  showHr={false}
/>
