# Split

The Split contract lets you specify multiple wallet addresses that are recipients of any revenue or royalty split.
    </p>

You define what percentage of any funds that get sent to the split contract address is sent to each recipient.
For example, you could define `0x1` and `0x2` as recipients, and configure them to receive 50% of the funds sent to the split contract.

  </div>
</div>

The split contract will store the funds, and when any user calls the `distribute` function, the funds will be distributed to the recipients according to the percentages you define.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Split contract to:

- Use as a "team wallet", where funds are distributed between the members of your team with set percentages
- Share revenue from your primary minting in an NFT drop
- Share revenue from royalty sales with members of your team, such as an artist
- Any programmatic split of revenue

:::info Native Token Storage

If your contract is storing both native tokens such as `ETH`, and ERC20 tokens such as `wrapped ETH`,
it will prompt you to accept two separate transactions to distribute the funds.
