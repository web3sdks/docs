# Edition

The **Edition** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset, but you **don't** want to "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract, the Edition contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) and perform any other actions you would expect to do with an NFT.

For advanced use-cases, the Edition also has [signature-based minting](/sdk/advanced-features/on-demand-minting) capabilities.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Edition contract to:

- Create an NFT Collection where each NFT has 100 copies
- Airdrop an NFT to a list of addresses that all use the same asset and metadata
- Create 10 "copies" of your artwork and sell them on a [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

## Using the Contract in the SDK

This page outlines how you can create and configure your edition drop contract using the [dashboard](https://web3sdks.com/dashboard).

You can also use our [SDK](/sdk) to create and interact with your contract.

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.
You can download our example [CSV File](https://web3sdks.com/airdrop.csv) to get started.
