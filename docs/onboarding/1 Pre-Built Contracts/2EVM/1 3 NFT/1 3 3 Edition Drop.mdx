The **Edition Drop** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset and uses the [ERC1155 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), also known as "Semi-Fungible Tokens".

The Edition Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can mint an NFT, including allowlists, release dates, and claim limits.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Edition Drop contract to:

- Create NFT Memberships such as our [Early Access Cards](https://opensea.io/collection/web3sdks-community) that you want your users to claim
- Release an item in your game for a limited-time
- Create 100 NFTs based on one art piece, and allow users to claim one per wallet

## Using the Contract in the SDK

This page outlines how you can create and configure your edition drop contract using the [dashboard](https://web3sdks.com/dashboard).

You can also use our [SDK](/sdk) to create and interact with your contract.

## Creating & Configuring the Edition Drop

Learn how to create and configure your smart contract using the [dashboard](https://web3sdks.com/dashboard).

### Creating an Edition Drop Contract

Deploy the edition drop contract to any of our
[supported networks](https://blog.web3sdks.com/guides/which-network-should-you-use) using the button below.

<div style={{ width: "fit-content" }}>
  <DeployThisContractButton
    link={"https://web3sdks.com/contracts/new/pre-built/token/edition-drop"}
    contractType="edition-drop"
  />
</div>

### Lazy Minting NFTs

Lazy minting is the process of uploading your metadata for your NFT(s) without minting them _yet_.

This is useful when you want _other_ wallets to mint NFTs from your drop into their own wallets.

To lazy-mint NFT(s), click **Create** to lazy-mint a single NFT, or **Batch Upload** to lazy-mint multiple NFTs at once.

![Create or Batch Upload Buttons](../assets/edition-drop-create.png)

To get started, you can use one of our example files for [CSV](https://web3sdks.com/example.csv) or [JSON](https://nightly.web3sdks.com/example.json) metadata.

      image="/assets/icons/education.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Setting Claim Phases

On the Edition Drop contract, you set claim phases for each NFT, by clicking the **Claim Phases** button

![Claim Phases](../assets/edition-drop-claim-phases.png)

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can claim an NFT from your drop.

**The Edition Drop contract supports multiple sequential claim phases**.

Within a claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs do you want to drop
- How much do you want to charge per NFT
- What currency do you want to use
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims

To add a claim phase to a token, click **Add Initial Claim Phase**:

![Add Initial Claim Phase](../assets/edition-drop-claim-phase-add.png)

### Airdrop NFTs

Click **Airdrop** on the token you want to use, and upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

![Airdrop](../assets/airdrop.png)

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.
You can download our example [CSV File](https://web3sdks.com/airdrop.csv) to get started.

### Contract Metadata

To configure the image, name, and description of the contract, click the **Settings** tab:

![Contract Metadata](../assets/edition-drop-settings.png)

### Royalty & Platform Fees

From the **Settings** tab, you also configure the [royalty fee](/dashboard/contract-settings),
[primary sales recipient](/dashboard/contract-settings#primary-sales-recipient)
and [platform fee](/dashboard/contract-settings).
