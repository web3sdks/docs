# Choosing the Right Pre-Built Contract

<div className="heroGrid">
<div>
<p>
Picking the contract that best suits your project can be made with a few key decisions:

<ol>
<li>What kind of project am I building? (NFTs, ERC20 tokens, a marketplace, etc.)</li>
<li>In what way do I want to release my project? (To be claimed by others, or just minted to me?)</li>
<li>Do I need custom functionality not provided by a pre-built contract? (Use <a href="https://docs.web3sdks.com/contractkit">ContractKit</a>).</li>
</ol>
