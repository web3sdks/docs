The Token contract is suited for creating a digital currency and is compliant with the [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard.
It can be purchased and traded between users on an exchange, utilized to buy and sell NFTs in a marketplace, etc.

Unlike the [Token Drop](/pre-built-contracts/token-drop) contract, the Token contract does not allow users to claim tokens under the
criteria of claim conditions.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Token contract to:

- Create your own cryptocurrency
- Sell your NFTs on the [Marketplace](/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) in your custom token
- Reward users with tokens for some action they take
