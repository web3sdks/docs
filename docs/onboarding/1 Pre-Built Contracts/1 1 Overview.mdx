# Pre-Built Contracts Overview

Pre-built contracts are written by the web3sdks team, and cover the most common use cases for smart contracts; each of them are:

- [Open source](https://github.com/web3sdks/contracts) and free to deploy (excl. gas fees)
- [Audited](https://gateway.web3sdks.dev/ipfs/QmWfueeKQrggrVQNjWkF4sYJECp56vNnuAXCPVecFFKz2j) and supported by our [bug bounty program](https://web3sdks.notion.site/web3sdks-Bug-Bounty-Program-f78d1db776ab4f0e974c9da176fcf706)
- Fully owned by the contract deployer _(you)_
- 10x cheaper to deploy than traditional contracts

## How Pre-Built Contracts Work

Each contract makes use of the extensions that are available in our [ContractKit](/contractkit),
and all come with a standard set of features that enable fine-grained control over the contract's behavior, such as:

- [Contract metadata](/dashboard/contract-settings#contract-metadata)
- [Permission controls](/dashboard/permission-controls)
- [Royalties and platform fees](/dashboard/contract-settings#royalty-fees)

When you deploy a prebuilt contract, under the hood you are creating a **proxy contract**;
which reduces the gas cost for you by **~90%**!

This works by having our smart contracts run the underlying logic, meaning you only deploy the code that is unique to _your_ contract.
This is possible since all prebuilt contracts run the same logic for things
like minting, transferring, and burning tokens.

Your contract stores knowledge of its metadata and state, for example; its name, and what NFTs have been minted so far.
For any logic (such as minting an NFT), it delegates this to our underlying smart contract to handle, since this logic is the same for every NFT collection.

You still maintain 100% ownership of the contract.
