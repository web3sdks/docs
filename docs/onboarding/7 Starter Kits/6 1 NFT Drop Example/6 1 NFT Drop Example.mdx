# NFT Drop

In this example, you'll learn how to create a website where users mint your NFTs!

We'll show you how to:

- Batch upload your NFTs from a `.csv` file or a `.json` file to **lazy-mint** all your NFTs.
- Set claim conditions, such as an allowlist, a limit on mints per wallet, and a release date.
- Create a custom NFT minting page for your users to mint NFTs from your drop.

## Demo

In the end, you'll have a production-ready NFT Drop that your users can mint from!

## Process

We'll run you through the process of:

1. creating your NFTs using our [NFT Drop contract](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop) and configuring your [claim phases](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#setting-claim-phases).
2. integrating the SDK into your application.
3. customizing the NFT Drop page to match your brand.
