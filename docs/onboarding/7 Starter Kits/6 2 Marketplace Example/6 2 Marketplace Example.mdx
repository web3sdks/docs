# Marketplace

In this example, you will learn how to create an **NFT Marketplace**!

We'll create an application with the following capabilities:

- A way to list NFTs for direct sale or auction.
- A way for users to make bids and buy NFTs.

## Demo

You'll have a production-ready NFT marketplace where your users can list and buy NFTs.
