# Token Gated Membership

In this example, you'll learn how to create a website that restricts content based on the ownership of an NFT.

In this guide, we'll use an [Edition Drop](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop).
The NFTs in this Drop will use the same asset with the [ERC1155 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
so that every owner has a "membership card" NFT.

We'll show you how to:

- Create your NFTs using web3sdks
- Create an application that connects to your NFT smart contract
- Restrict content based on ownership of an NFT

## Demo

In the end, you'll have a production-ready NFT Drop that your users can mint from!
