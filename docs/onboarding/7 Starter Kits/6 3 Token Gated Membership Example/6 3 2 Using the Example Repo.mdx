# Creating a Restricted Application based on NFTs

We have created a template for you to use your [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) to restrict access to
the application to only holders of an NFT in your collection.

In the example, we also provide a page for users to claim one of your NFTs to then access the website too.

:::info

In this section, we assume you have some knowledge of how to run commands,
and have Node JS installed on your machine.

## Cloning the Token Gated Membership Example Repository

You can create your copy of this [template repository](https://github.com/web3sdks-template/nft-gated-website)
by using the web3sdks CLI, or downloading the repository as a `.zip` file and unzipping it from the GitHub URL.

```bash
npx web3sdks@latest create --template nft-gated-website
```

To start running the code locally, run the command below.

```bash npm2yarn
cd nft-gated-website # this is the name of your project you created
npm run dev # run the local dev server
```

## Configure your Edition Drop Contract Address

Replace the value of the contract address inside of the `yourDetails.js` file with the address of your Edition Drop contract.

## Configure the Network

In our example repository, we enforce users to be on the `Mumbai` test network when checking whether the user owns one of the NFTs.

If you are on a different network, you'll need to configure this value inside the `index.js` file.

```jsx
// This is the chainId your dApp will work on.
const activeChainId = ChainId.Mumbai;
```

We also ensure users are on the correct network when they click the mint button, so you'll need to configure this here too:

```jsx
if (networkMismatch) {
  switchNetwork(ChainId.Mumbai); // Configure this to your network
  return;
}
```

## Configure the Styles

You can configure any of the styles inside the `/styles` directory to change the look and feel of the
application to match your brand.
