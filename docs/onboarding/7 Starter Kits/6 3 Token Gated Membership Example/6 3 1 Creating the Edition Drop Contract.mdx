# Creating an Edition Drop Contract

In this section, we'll show how to:

- Create the smart contract that will be used to store our NFTs.
- Configure the metadata such as the name, image, description, and royalty fees of the Edition Drop.
- Deploy the contract to a test network, and set up our [claim phases](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop#setting-claim-phases).

## Creating an Edition Drop Contract

To create an [Edition Drop](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract,
head to the [dashboard](https://web3sdks.com/dashboard) and connect your wallet.

Then click on the **Deploy New Contract** button.

![Create a new contract](../assets/create-new-contract.png)

Since we want to **lazy mint** our NFTs, as well as use the same asset for many NFTs,
the **Edition Drop** contract is best suited for this.

Select **Edition Drop** from the list of contracts and click **Deploy Now**.

![Select Edition Drop Contract](../assets/edition-drop-contract-on-dashboard.png)

You can configure the **Name**, **Symbol**, **Description**, **Image**, and
[Royalty fees](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop#royalty--platform-fees) in the settings before you deploy your Edition Drop.

I'll call my Edition Drop `Shape Club Membership Card` and stick with the default values for the rest of the fields,
but feel free to go wild and configure this to your liking!

![Configure Edition Drop Contract Metadata](../assets/configure-edition-contract-metadata.png)

Once you're happy, let's deploy this Edition Drop onto the Mumbai (MATIC) Test network.

![Deploy onto Mumbai](../assets/deploy-onto-mumbai.png)

This will prompt you to accept a transaction in MetaMask (or whatever wallet you connected with),
and deploy your smart contract onto the Mumbai Test network!

You might notice that the transaction is requesting to Deploy a **Proxy**.

If you want to learn more about proxy contracts, check out our documentation on
[How web3sdks prebuilt contracts work](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts#how-web3sdks-pre-built-contracts-work).

Now we're ready to create our NFT inside this Edition Drop.

## Creating the Membership NFT

Let's create our NFT inside the Edition Drop by clicking the **Create** button.

![Create Membership NFT](../assets/create-membership-nft.png)

Enter a name, media file, description, properties, and advanced metadata for your Membership card NFT.

![Configure Edition NFT](../assets/configure-edition-nft.png)

Once you're happy, click **Create Edition Drop** and confirm the `Lazy Mint` transaction.

## Configuring Claim Phases

[Claim Phases](https://docs.web3sdks.com/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop#setting-claim-phases) are conditions
we can configure to define **when** and **how** users can claim NFTs from our Edition Drop.

For example, a popular claim phase pattern is to have one claim phase where allow-listed wallets can claim,
then another claim phase after that, where _any_ wallet can claim.

In the Edition Drop contract, you can set different claim phases per NFT inside the edition.

From the dashboard, click **Settings** on the NFT we just created to bring up the Claim Phase configuration.

Click on **Add Phase**, and configure it to your liking!

![Configure Claim Phases](../assets/configure-edition-claim-phases.png)

I will change the `How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction?` to be `1` and accept the default values for the other fields.

![Update Claim Phases](../assets/update-claim-phases.png)

Once you're happy with your claim phase(s), click **Update Claim Phases** and approve the transaction!

Now you're ready for users to claim the NFT!

## Bonus Tip: SDK Deployments

You can do everything we just did in code using the SDK too!

**Deploy the NFT Drop contract:**

<Web3sdksCodeSnippet
  contract={"ContractDeployer"}
  name={"deployEditionDrop"}
  showHr={false}
/>

**Set Claim Conditions:**

<Web3sdksCodeSnippet
  contract={"EditionDrop"}
  name={"claimConditions"}
  showHr={false}
/>
