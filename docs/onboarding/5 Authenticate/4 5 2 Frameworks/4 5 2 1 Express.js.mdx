Auth can be integrated into [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) apps to enable wallet-based login. We'll go over the necessary setup below.

## Installation

First, we need to install the `@web3sdks/auth` package as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3sdks/auth
```

## Setup

We need to setup an admin private key used to secure our authentication. We can do this by creating a new `.env` file at the top level of the project and adding a private key to the file:

```
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning Private Key Best Practices

It is not secure to store your private key in an environment variable.

[Learn how to use a secret manager as we recommend here](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key)

:::

Next, we'll want to setup the Auth endpoints to enable users to login and logout with their wallet.

We can do this by passing our Express app into the `Web3sdksAuth` function, which will configure all the endpoints we need:

```js
import express from "express";
import { getUser, Web3sdksAuth } from "@web3sdks/auth/express";
import { config } from "dotenv";

// Here we use dotenv to import environment variables
config();

const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;

// Now we can configure our endpoints with Auth
Web3sdksAuth(app, {
  // Using environment variables to secure your private key is a security vulnerability.
  // Learn how to store your private key securely:
  // https://docs.web3sdks.com/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  privateKey: process.env.ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
  // Set this to your domain to prevent signature malleability attacks.
  domain: "example.com",
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here, we configure Auth with the Web3sdksAuth function, passing in our private key and domain (used to prevent phishing attacks).

:::info

Importantly, the domain value here must match the domain that we use on the frontend when calling the login function.

:::

This is all it takes to setup Auth for your Express.js backends. Now let's take a look at what you can do with this.

## Usage

Once we setup Auth, the following endpoints will be added to our backend:

**GET - `/api/auth/login`** - Sets a JWT token for the user, allowing them to login with their wallet

**GET - `/api/auth/user`** - Gets the address of the user making a request (by accessing their JWT token)

**GET - `/api/auth/logout`** - Destroys the JWT token, logging out the user

### getUser

Additionally, you will be able to use the `getUser` function to get the authenticated user off the request object from any other endpoint as follows:

```js
import { getUser } from "@web3sdks/auth/express";

app.get("/secret", (req, res) => {
  // Get the user off the request object
  const user = getUser(req);

  // If there is not authenticated user, the user value will be null
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "Not authorized.",
    });
  }

  // Otherwise, user.address will be defined
  return res.status(200).json({
    message: user.address,
  });
});
```
