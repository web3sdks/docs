Auth can be integrated with [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) to add wallet-based login along with standard OAuth flows. Next Auth enables plugins to over 40 OAuth providers and over 10 different types of databases, enabling many plugins for your wallet-based apps.

We'll go over the necessary setup below.

## Installation

First, we need to install the `@web3sdks/auth` and `next-auth` packages as follows:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3sdks/auth next-auth
```

## Setup

We need to setup an admin private key used to secure our authentication. We can do this by creating a new `.env.local` file at the top level of the project and adding a private key to the file:

```
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

:::warning Private Key Best Practices

It is not secure to store your private key in an environment variable.

[Learn how to use a secret manager as we recommend here](/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key).

:::

Next, we'll want to setup the Next Auth endpoints to enable users to login and logout with their wallet, along with whatever other OAuth providers and configuration we want to setup for Next Auth. We need to do this by adding the proper configuration to the `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file.

Here, we can see an example of setting up our backend to support login with Google as well as wallet login.

```js
import GoogleProvider from "next-auth/providers/google";
import { Web3sdksNextAuth } from "@web3sdks/auth/next-auth";

export const { NextAuthHandler, getUser } = Web3sdksNextAuth({
  // Learn how to store your private key securely:
  // https://docs.web3sdks.com/sdk/set-up-the-sdk/securing-your-private-key
  privateKey: process.env.ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY || "",
  // Set this to your domain to prevent signature malleability attacks.
  domain: "example.com",
  // And we can add in any additional next auth configuration we want to use
  nextOptions: {
    // In this case, we'll enable Google OAuth login as well
    providers: [
      GoogleProvider({
        clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID || "",
        clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET || "",
      }),
    ],
  },
});

export default NextAuthHandler();
```

Here, we configure Auth with the `Web3sdksNextAuth` function, passing in our private key and domain (used to prevent phishing attacks).

:::info

Importantly, the `domain` value here must match the `domain` that we use on the frontend when calling the `login` function.

:::

This is all it takes to setup Auth with Next Auth. Now let's take a look at what you can do with this.

## Usage

Once we setup Auth, we get two functions:

### NextAuthHandler

The `NextAuthHandler` handles configuration of all the Next Auth endpoints used for login, logout, and other authentication concerns. It should be exported as the default export from the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` file.

### getUser

The `getUser` function lets you get the user data of the authenticated user making a request to any other endpoint you may want to setup, including their `address`. You can use it in another endpoint as follows:

```javascript
// Import getUser from wherever you created the config
import { getUser } from "/pages/api/auth/[...web3sdks]";

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  // Get the authenticated user from the request
  const user = await getUser(req);

  // If the user is not authenticated, user will be null
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(401).json({
      message: "Not authorized.",
    });
  }

  // Otherwise, user.address will be set
  return res.status(200).json({
    address: user.address,
  });
};

export default handler;
```

## Frontend

Now that our Next Auth backend setup, we can easily setup our React frontend (automatically included in Next.js) with a few hooks and buttons to enable login with wallet.

First, we'll need to install the `@web3sdks/react` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @web3sdks/react ethers
```

Now, in the `_app.js` file, we'll need to wrap our app with the `Web3sdksProvider` and provide some configuration for Auth, as well as the Next Auth `SessionProvider`:

```jsx
import { Web3sdksProvider } from "@web3sdks/react";
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

export default function MyApp({
  Component,
  pageProps: { session, ...pageProps },
}) {
  return (
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <Web3sdksProvider desiredChainId={1}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </Web3sdksProvider>
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}
```

Now we can use Auth to create a button on the frontend that will let users login with their wallet:

```jsx
import { useSDK, useAddress, useMetamask } from "@web3sdks/react";
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";

const Home = () => {
  const sdk = useSDK();
  const address = useAddress();
  const connect = useMetamask();

  const loginWithWallet = async () => {
    // Set this to your domain to prevent signature malleability attacks.
    const domain = "example.com";
    const payload = await sdk?.auth.login(domain);
    // And then we pass it into the next-auth signIn function
    await signIn("credentials", { payload: JSON.stringify(payload) });
  };

  return (
    <>
      {address ? (
        <button onClick={loginWithWallet}>Login with Wallet</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>
      )}
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

You can also access the current session data for the current user through Next Auth's `useSession` hook:

```jsx
import { useSession } from "next-auth/react";
const Home = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  // Now we can render the current session object, including the session.user field
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(session || null)}</pre>;
};
```
