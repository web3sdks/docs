## Web3Button variable

> This feature is currently in beta and may change based on feedback that we receive.

A component that allows the user to call an on-chain function on a contract.

The button has to be wrapped in a `Web3sdksProvider` in order to function.

## Example

```javascript
import { Web3Button } from "@web3sdks/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Web3Button
        contractAddress="0x..."
        action={(contract) => contract.erc721.transfer("0x...", 1)}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
Web3Button: <TAction extends ActionFn>({
  contractAddress,
  onSuccess,
  onError,
  onSubmit,
  isDisabled,
  contractAbi,
  children,
  action,
  className,
  ...themeProps
}: PropsWithChildren<Web3ButtonProps<TAction>>) => JSX.Element;
```
