# MerkleProof

_These functions deal with verification of Merkle Trees proofs. The proofs can be generated using the JavaScript library https://github.com/miguelmota/merkletreejs. Note: the hashing algorithm should be keccak256 and pair sorting should be enabled. See `test/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.test.js` for some examples.
