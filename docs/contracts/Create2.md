# Create2

_Helper to make usage of the `CREATE2` EVM opcode easier and safer. `CREATE2` can be used to compute in advance the address where a smart contract will be deployed, which allows for interesting new mechanisms known as &#39;counterfactual interactions&#39;. See the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014#motivation for more information._
