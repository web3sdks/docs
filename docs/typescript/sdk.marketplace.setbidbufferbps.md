## Marketplace.setBidBufferBps() method

Set the Auction bid buffer

## Example

```javascript
// the bid buffer in basis points
const bufferBps = 5_00; // 5%
await contract.setBidBufferBps(bufferBps);
```

**Signature:**

```typescript
setBidBufferBps(bufferBps: BigNumberish): Promise<void>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type         | Description   |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| bufferBps | BigNumberish | the bps value |

**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Remarks

A percentage (e.g. 5%) in basis points (5% = 500, 100% = 10000). A new bid is considered to be a winning bid only if its bid amount is at least the bid buffer (e.g. 5%) greater than the previous winning bid. This prevents buyers from making very slightly higher bids to win the auctioned items.
