const executions = [
  {
    // The contract you want to make a call to
    toAddress: "0x...",
    // The amount of the native currency to send in this transaction
    nativeTokenValue: 0,
    // Transaction data that will be executed when the proposal is executed
    // This is an example transfer transaction with a token contract (which you would need to setup in code)
    transactionData: tokenContract.encoder.encode("transfer", [
      fromAddress,
      amount,
    ]),
  },
